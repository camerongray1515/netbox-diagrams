# Work in progress!

This is a simple project to integrate mxGraph (the core component of draw.io)
into NetBox (https://github.com/digitalocean/netbox).  Initially it will
allow the editor to be used as part of the main NetBox interface and will save
and load diagrams from the NetBox database.  This could likely be enhanced to
allow objects in the diagrams to be linked to entities within NetBox itself.

Since NetBox does not provide official support for plugins, it takes some
slight modifications to integrate this into NetBox - Documentation will follow.
